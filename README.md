ABSTRACT
• Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a branch of artificial intelligence and computer vision that focuses on automating handwritten text into digital format.
• HTR plays a crucial role in preserving and digitizing historical documents, manuscripts, and archives containing handwritten text.
• Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) can play a role in human personality detection through the analysis of handwriting characteristics, a field known as graphology.
• Graphology is a method of identifying, evaluating and understanding human personality traits through the strokes and patterns revealed by handwriting.
• It suggests that various aspects of a person's handwriting, such as letter size, slant, spacing, pressure, and shape, can provide insights into their personality traits, emotions, and psychological state.
• The objective of this project is to develop a system that takes an image document containing the handwriting of a person and output a few of his/her personality traits based on some selected handwriting features.
• This system is proposed to automate graphology's basic handwriting analysis tasks to determine a few important personality traits.
• To make this happen, we consider seven handwriting features to predict eight personality traits of a writer:
(i) size of letters
(ii) slant of the writing
(iii) baseline
(iv) pen pressure
(v) spacing between letters
(vi) spacing between words
(vii) top margin in a document
• After extracting all these features from the image containing the handwriting, eight support vector machines are trained which output each personality trait of the writer.
• Carefully analysing all the significant characteristics of handwriting manually is not only time-consuming but prone to errors as well. Automating the analysis of a few selected characteristics of handwriting will speed up the process and reduce errors.
• The proposed methodology involves several key steps: initial data collection and preprocessing, where handwritten samples are gathered and standardized for analysis.
• Feature extraction techniques are employed to capture relevant aspects of the handwriting, such as stroke patterns, letter formations, and spatial characteristics. These features are then used to train machine learning models capable of predicting personality traits based on the input handwritten text.
• Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with the trained models achieving high accuracy in predicting personality traits across various handwriting styles and samples.
• The system's interpretability allows for meaningful insights into the relationship between handwriting patterns and personality characteristics.
• This innovative approach merges psychology with machine learning, offering a cost- effective and reliable means of personality analysis through handwriting.

INFERENCE:
Handwriting analysis offers a fascinating avenue for inferring personality traits using AI. By examining various aspects of handwriting such as size, pressure, slant, and style, it's possible to make educated guesses about an individual's emotional stability, confidence, introversion/extroversion, attention to detail, creativity, stress levels, openness to experience, organizational skills, assertiveness, and social adaptability.
